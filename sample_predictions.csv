pseudoscience category   im assuming that this article is in the pseudoscience category because of its association with creationism  however there are modern scientificallyaccepted variants of catastrophism that have nothing to do with creationism — and theyre even mentioned in the article  i think the connection to pseudoscience needs to be clarified or the article made more general and less creationismspecific and the category tag removed entirely,0,0

 ccbysa is probably the most common variation used on both wikipedia and commons it is also in a way compatible with the gfdl used by default any limitations might disqualify it as free enough for wikipedia most notably free images here must allow for commercial reuse again for gfdl compatibility i presume so nc is out of the question though im not an expert on this you can check the upload wizard follow the own work path and see the available choices though you might also seriously consider uploading the image to commons instead to allow wider use  ,0,0

there are so many articles that wish to down play the parts of the jw religion that they really dont understand  i will not go back in and change the article  if people want to discredit something they dont understand that is ok  this being said is in no way directed to anyone in particular  i just find it interesting that people want to write up document reports on religions that they are no part of  there are pages on cathlics baptist and other religions that state opinions of people who are not even a part of those religions  to me and this is personal it is very sad when there are people who will critically analzye something that they do not believe in themselves  oh well,0,0

  that is not a list of official names of official neighborhoods their is no such list that exists that is a of neighborhood names of which more then half are no longer used that are taken from  philadelphia almanac and citizens manual which was edited by kenneth finkel and published by the library company of philadelphia in  and  it has been augmented by the staff of the philadelphia city archives  the  edition of this book contained  different names of various neighborhoods throughout the city of philadelphia from the earliest days of swedish occupation to the present the following year an additional six names were added to bring the list to  this list is being augmented yet again by the philadelphia city archives with names of neighborhoods redevelopment areas and other place names which have been assigned officially or unofficially to certain areas of the city it is interesting to see the dynamics of neighborhood naming in over  years of occupation of the  square miles which comprise philadelphia by the native americans the swedes the english and german pioneers and later and current philadelphians      trácht ar ,0,0

  july  utc  there are a number of key words or red flags on wikipedia they have a very strong effect in the community disruptive editing is one of them if you want to abuse your position as a trusted editor here you say the editor you have a difference of opinion with is disruptive when he or she simply has a different opinion  as you so correctly mentioned confidently demonstrating with reliable sources that a statement is an encyclopedic statement appropriate to be on wp is not disruptive editing however the term disruptive editing is one of a number of terms abused by abusive editors on wp it is very disheartening when some trusted editor immediately use that term against you when you simply have a different opinion they know the power of that word that is why they use it there are a number of these power words used in the wp community abusively using this tactic is a personal attack  in my opinion the other editor involved here also stated my contributions in various articles is wasting wikipedians´ time he also considers the fact that i address you and other editors by name as something that can be used in a negative way against me   ,0,0

  to paul b or whomever has taken the responsibility for editting this work while i admire your dedication to upholding a neutral point of view in this article i must voice the opinion that youre lack acknowledgment towards the fact that he iswas a controversial figure to indians is not inline in general with wikipedia there are many examples of articles on this website that provide info about controversial issues in a neutral position while usually providing material for and against the issue i think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of max muller one other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion because i am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it finally your vehement refutation of other sources based on who is he shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others i would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article please do so by giving both sides of the story incidentally im not a nationalist and im not a member of hindutwa i am however a person that likes to search for and be presented with all relevant informations whether they are contradictory to my own opinion or not  raj,0,0

   unauthorised change   on  january  ie just in the last few weeks  changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the english language to cebce as he well knows this violates wpmos specifically wpera which requires that any change to an articles date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with articlespecific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed as is clearly evident to everyone none of these steps have taken place in this case  instead in the two and fro of the last few weeks as aesop has gone back and forth between the queens english and cebce mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated  months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of  apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard english state for  months continuously may  to january  those comments were never enough to justify the change to cebce even back then this is of course because as mentioned earlier wpera requires that articlespecific reasons be given and consensus established neither occured then what we see from  can at best be called a disgrace it was merely dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it the discussion went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the queens english which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then to cebce therefore didnt proceed at least until  months later when mzilikazi decided to try again this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure  if mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change aesop from the established english language abbreviations to cebce then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing   ,0,0

  advice to save me writing too much a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines  there is plenty of advice available in fact a confusing amount so pointers may be helpful the guide to writing your first article and the business faq are particularly useful  wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the neutral point of view which is one of our three key content policies the others are verifiability and no original research however the anonymity of account names means it cant be prohibited and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously  it should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that wont get deleted if you are careful the first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion  be drily factual as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it but were documenting it for completeness see the guideline on peacock terms  the next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new  notability which is the wikipedia term for of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article see the guidelines on notability and notability organisations and companies what you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you your own website etc are not considered independent has there been comment on your organisation eg in the trade press it may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references  i wrote the above offline now that i come to post it i see you have run into another problem  copyright thats more of a problem than you might think because everything in wp must released under the gfdl which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use  so just saying i agree to this being put in is not enough the notice above tells you what you can do but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for wikipedia so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it that leads me to a last warning an important difference between wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article  see wpown  other people can and will edit it see the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit if you dont want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it  regards   ,0,0
